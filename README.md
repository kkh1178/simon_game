# Simon Game


### An app that recreates the classic Simon game from the 80s! 


Using JavaScript and jQuery, the app generates a color and adds a new color to the sequence with each new level. The player has to remember the correct sequence in order to get to the next level. 


Here is a gif that show the app in action:
